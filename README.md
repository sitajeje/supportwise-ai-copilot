# SupportWise AI Co-pilot (MVP)

An AI-powered analytics and co-pilot for customer support teams, built with:

- Next.js (frontend)
- Supabase (Postgres + pgvector)
- Node.js scripts for data ingestion and processing
- Synthetic Zendesk-like ticket data (no real customer data)

This repository is designed as a portfolio-grade project to demonstrate:

- Data modeling and analytics over ticket data
- Semantic search and vector retrieval (pgvector)
- LLM-based question answering and routing between SQL metrics and semantic evidence
- A clean, extensible frontend architecture for analytics and chat-based exploration
